            <p class="description">
                Form fill and seal packaging machines are the most widely used flexible packaging equipment type. Invented in 1936 by an employee of a candy company, these machines are considered industry standard, tried and true technology. 

So how do they do what they do? In a nutshell, form fill seal machines form bags from a large roll of flat packaging material, fill the bags with product, and seal them shut.

Some machines perform these operations horizontally (horizontal form fill seal or HFFS) and some do it vertically (vertical form fill seal or VFFS). Vertical form fill seal machines have certain advantages over horizontal machines, including a lower cost and requiring much less floor space.

Form fill seal machines can run fast and are economical in cost. However, operation and changeover require technical skill so they are usually best for lines with a dedicated operator that run with little variety. A subset of vertical form fill seal packaging machines, stick pack machines perform their operations in much the same manner, only across multiple lanes to create many packages at once.

They do this with a special slitting component that cuts the large roll of packaging film into strips or 'sticks'. After being slit, each stick is formed into a long, thin bag shape, then filled with product (usually powder or liquid), and finally, each stick is sealed shut.

With modern machines able to accommodate up to 20 stick packaging lanes, you can achieve very high throughput with very little floor space, making them a very popular choice for contract packagers.</p>
